## Sql Query Solution for the Case Study

1. Repeated Returners
SELECT CustomerID,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quantity < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ReturnOrders,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Quantity < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS ReturnRate
FROM 'cleaned data.csv' (ignore_errors=true)
WHERE CustomerID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY CustomerID
HAVING ReturnRate > 30
ORDER BY ReturnRate DESC;

2. Most returned products
SELECT Description,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quantity < 0 THEN ABS(Quantity) ELSE 0 END) AS TotalReturns,
       COUNT(DISTINCT InvoiceNo) AS ReturnInvoices
FROM 'cleaned data.csv' (ignore_errors=true)
GROUP BY Description
ORDER BY TotalReturns DESC
LIMIT 10;

3. The return rate per product category
SELECT Category,
       COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders,
       SUM(CASE WHEN Quantity < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ReturnOrders,
       ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN Quantity < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS ReturnRate
FROM 'cleaned data.csv' (ignore_errors=true)
GROUP BY Category
ORDER BY ReturnRate DESC;
