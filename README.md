# 📦 E-Commerce Return Analysis – Case Study

This project analyzes real-world e-commerce transaction data to uncover return patterns and suggest data-driven solutions for minimizing product returns. It uses **Python, SQL (DuckDB), Power BI**, and Excel for cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding.

## Problem Statement
"Try, Use, and Return — The Silent Leak in E-Commerce"
What began as a customer-friendly return policy has quietly become a loophole
In the world of modern e-commerce, flexible return policies were introduced as a powerful selling point — to build trust, reduce purchase hesitation, and enhance customer satisfaction. But what was once a customer-centric feature has quietly evolved into a costly loophole.
A growing number of consumers have started to misuse return policies. Many purchase items — especially in categories like clothing, electronics, and accessories — with the full intention of returning them after minimal use.
